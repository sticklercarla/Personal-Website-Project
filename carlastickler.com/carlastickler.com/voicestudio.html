                       <span>Carla Stickler Voice Studio</span>
                       <br>
                            Carla maintains a private voice studio in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York as well as online via Skype. She spent years learning how to tweak her classical technique to accommodate the rigors of high belting required to sing much of today's Broadway repertoire. Carla loves helping her students find their mix, belt, falsetto, twang and much more!  <br>
                            She is a proud member of the National Association of Teachers of Singing, the Educational Theatre Association, and Musical Theatre Educators' Alliance. She holds certifications from the CCM Institute and a 40 hour Voice Teacher Training and Certification through New York Vocal Coaching along with a BFA from NYU-Tisch School of the Arts and an MA from NYU-Steinhardt School of Education. Carla is on the voice faculty at CAP21/Malloy College and Marymount Manhattan College.
